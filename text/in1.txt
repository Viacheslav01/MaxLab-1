William Shakespeare is one of (the) greatest writers.
Though he lived four centuries ago, a lot of theatres still perform his plays. They are still popular, and Shakespeare fans believe they was popular in the future too!
Shakespeare career started in London where he worked as an actor, wrote sonnets and plays,
When his first play published, the young writer felt very happy. He thought it was the best day in all his life,
At that time, he didnt know what (great) fame was waiting for him years later,
All Shakespeare tragedies, like Hamlet, Othello. King Lear and others are about love and betray, honour and lies,
These things will (always) be (important) to us, wont they?
